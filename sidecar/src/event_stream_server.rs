//! Event stream server
//!
//! The event stream server provides clients with an event-stream returning Server-Sent Events
//! (SSEs) holding JSON-encoded data.
//!
//! The actual server is run in backgrounded tasks.
//!
//! This module currently provides both halves of what is required for an API server:
//! a component implementation that interfaces with other components via being plugged into a
//! reactor, and an external facing http server that manages SSE subscriptions on a single endpoint.
//!
//! This component is passive and receives announcements made by other components while never making
//! a request of other components itself. The handled announcements are serialized to JSON and
//! pushed to subscribers.
//!
//! This component uses a ring buffer for outbound events providing some robustness against
//! unintended subscriber disconnects, if a disconnected subscriber re-subscribes before the buffer
//! has advanced past their last received event.
//!
//! For details about the SSE model and a list of supported SSEs, see:
//! <https://github.com/CasperLabs/ceps/blob/master/text/0009-client-api.md#rpcs>
