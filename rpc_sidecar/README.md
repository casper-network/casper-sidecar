## Synopsis

The Casper Event Sidecar is a process that connects to the RPC port of a Casper node and exposes a JSON-RPC interface for interacting with that node. The RPC protocol allows for basic operations like querying global state, sending transactions and deploys, etc. All of the RPC methods are documented [here](https://docs.casper.network/developers/json-rpc/).

## Protocol
The sidecar maintains a TCP connection with the node and communicates using a custom binary protocol built on top of [Juliet](https://github.com/casper-network/juliet). The protocol uses a request-response model where the sidecar sends simple self-contained requests and the node responds to them. The requests can be split into these main categories:
- read requests
    - queries for transient in-memory information like the 
      current block height, peer list, component status etc.
    - queries for database items, with both the database and the key 
      always being explicitly specified by the sidecar
- execute transaction requests
    - request to submit a transaction for execution
    - request to speculatively execute a transaction 

## Discovering the JSON RPC API

Once running, the Sidecar can be queried for its JSON RPC API using the `rpc.discover` method, as shown below. The result will be a list of RPC methods and their parameters.

```bash
curl -X POST http://localhost:<RPC_SERVER_PORT>/rpc -H 'Content-Type: application/json' -d '{"jsonrpc": "2.0", "method": "rpc.discover", "id": 1}'
```
